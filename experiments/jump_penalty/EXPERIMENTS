EXPERIMENTS

1. KNL dense vs sparse vs unrolled (Is there an ots sparse gemm I can use?)
2. Instruction cache saturation for unrolled
3. Breaking past the instruction cache saturation problem: Cost of an indirect jump
4. Performance of Seissol proxy



* Tiled vs blocked vs padded vs general
* padded vs padded with extracted diagonal
* Diagonal?
* Tensor?

* Beta=0
